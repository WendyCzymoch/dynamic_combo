What it does
============
Start the rails server and look at localhost:3000/static_pages/home. Simple page is shown and when you change the
value in the combo box, the text is dynamically changed showing the selected city.

How it works
============
When you request the above page, it is routed to the 'home' method of controller and static_pages/home.html.erb is
displayed.

This code creates the combo box:
--------------------------------

<div id="select_div">
    <select name="city_id" id="city_id">
      <option value="0">Lisbon</option>
      <option value="1">Madrid</option>
      <option value="2">Prague</option>
    </select>
</div>


This is the <div> that gets updated:
------------------------------------

<div id="result_div">
  <h4>Lisbon is selected</h4>
</div>

This is the script that watches for the change and does AJAX call to the controller:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#city_id').change(function() {
        $.ajax({
           url: "<%= update_text_path %>",
           data: {
               city_name: $("#city_id option:selected").text()
            },
           dataType: "script"
        });
    });
  });
</script>

Some more details about the script:
-----------------------------------

$('#city_id').change(function() ... this waits for the change of a specific control with id: city_id

url: "<%= update_text_path %>" ... path and method that gets called, when the change is done. this path is defined in
                                   routing, see config/routes.rb: get "static_pages/update_text", as: "update_text".
                                   This line creates a named value called update_text_path that routes to
                                   static_pages/update text method

city_name: $("#city_id option:selected").text() ... retrieves the selected text from the combo; if you need to get the
                                                    option value, you can use city_id: $('#city_id').val()

AJAX call processing
--------------------

When the controller method static_pages/update_text (controllers/static_pages_controller.rb) gets called,
it retrieves the city name from the parameter using params[:city_name] and stores it into @city_text. As this is an
AJAX call, the view that gets processed has to be .js, so after the city name is stored in the controller,
the update_text.js.erb gets called (views/static_pages/update_text.js.erb). In this file the html of "result_div"
gets updated, causing the text to update on the HTML page.
